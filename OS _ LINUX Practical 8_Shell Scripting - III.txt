PRACTICAL NO- 8 Shell Scripting – III
1] Write a shell script to accept c or C++ file from the user, compile it, execute this file
and display the output.
Code:

-------#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
printf("Hello World !!\n");
}
vi 471.c
-----------echo "Enter c program file"
read f1
if [ -f$f1 ]
then
echo "$f1 exist"
echo "Compiling and executing $f1 file"
cc -o a1.out $f1
echo "The output of $f1 file is "
./a1.out
else
echo "$f1 file does not exist."
fi

Output:
[tybscit@localhost Desktop]$ sh 471.c
Enter c program file

47.c exist
Compiling and executing 47.c file
The output of 47.c file is

if [ -f$f2 ]
then
echo "$f2 already exists,can,t copy"
else

echo "$f2 doesn't exist"
cp $test2 $f2
echo "Target file"
cat $f2
fi
;;
3)echo "Enter new name for file"
read nm
mv $test2 $nm;;
4) echo
"Deleting the
file" rm $f2;;
5)echo "Exit"
exit 0;;

Code: vi test4
while [ true ]
do
echo "enter student rollno"
read sno
x=`grep -c "$sno" student`
if [ $x -gt 0 ]
then
echo "$sno rollNo already exists"
else
echo "$sno doesn’t exists"
echo "enter student name:"

enter student rollno
8325
8325 doesn’t exists
enter student name:
reshma
Enter students marks
80

Now the contents of student file are:
8325:reshma:80

5] Create 2 files as follows Master Data(ProdNo, ProdNm, RateOfSale, Description) and
Transdata(custData, ProdNo, CustNm, Units sold).Fields are separated by colon. Write

1) Product Query
2) Customer Query
3) Exit
Code:
ProductQuery()
{
echo "enter product no "
read pno
echo "details of $pno product are "
grep "$pno" MasterData
echo "do you want to see another product (y/n) ? "
read ans
if [ $ans = "y" ]
then
ProductQuery
else
sh Q5
fi
break
}
CustomerQuery()
{
echo "enter customer code "
read cno
echo "details of $cno customer are "
grep "$cno" TransData
echo "do you want to see another customer(y/n) ?"
read ans
if [ $ans = "y" ]
then
CustomerQuery
else
sh Q5
fi
break
}
echo "Select your choice "
echo "1. Product Query"
echo "2. Customer Query"
echo "3. Exit"
while [ true ]
do
echo "Enter your Choice"

read ch
case $ch in
1)ProductQuery;;
2)CustomerQuery;;

done

Output:
[tybscit@localhost ~]$ sh test 5
Select your choice
1. Product Query
2. Customer Query
3. Exit
Enter your Choice 1
enter product no p02
details of p02 product are
